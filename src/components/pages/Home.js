            Mastermind is a code-breaking challenge where you will try to crack
            a secret combination in just 10 tries. Have fun trying to crack the
            code!{" "}

          <ul>
            <li>
              The computer will generate a secret combination: 4-digits (easy),
              5-digits (medium), 6-digits (hard).
            </li>
            <li>
              Each digit in the secret number will be within the range of 0 - 7,
              inclusive.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              You will have 10 attempts to guess this number, which can have
              repeating digits.
            </li>
            <li>
              After each guess, you will receive feedback on how many digits you
              correctly guessed and/or how many digits are in the correct
              location.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the feedback to get closer to the number within 10 tries!
            </li>
            <li>
              If you find yourself struggling, you can always ask for a quick
              hint!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you really want further customization, you can also choose the
            number of digits and guesses! The number of digits must between 2
            and 10, while the number of guesses must between 2 and 20.
